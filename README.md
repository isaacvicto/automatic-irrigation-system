# Automatic Irrigation System

## Introduction
The system is created for maintaining the moisture level between 30% - 70%. This prototype can be scaled and modified for different types of crops and herbs cultivation. This system is prepared using YL-69 moisture sensor, 8051 microcontroller and 16x2 LCD display to display relevant information.

## Components Required
* 8051 microcontroller
* YL-69 moisture sensor
* YL-38 comparator module
* 16x2 LCD display
* Analog to Digital Converter
* L293D Motor Driver
* Motor Pump
* 220V-AC to 5V-DC Power Supply
* Capacitors, Resistors and wires

## Software
I have used MikroC software to code and load the program. You can download from here Link
